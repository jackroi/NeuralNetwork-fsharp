## 🧐 About <a name="about"></a>
A simple neural network library built for learning purposes. The library is written in F# using functional programming paradigm.


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Prerequisites
You should have a working F# development enviroment (follow [this](https://fsharp.org/))


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
The usage of the library is simple, all the code is well documented and there is an [example](./NeuralNetwork-fsharp/Main.fs) that solves the XOR problem.


## ⛏️ Built Using <a name="built_using"></a>
- [F#](https://fsharp.org/) - Functional programming language


## ✍️ Authors <a name="authors"></a>
- [@jackroi](https://github.com/jackroi) - F# implementation
